PCB Schematics and Layouts
==========================

The schematics and the layout of files for the |BMS-Master|, the |BMS-Extension|, the |BMS-Interface| and the |BMS-Slave| are available in their dedicated `GitHub repository <https://github.com/foxBMS/foxBMS-hardware/tree/release-1.0.x>`_.

.. note::
	To open the schematic and layout files, please download `AUTODESK EAGLE <https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview>`_. 

This repository also contains the bill of material (BOM) and a PDF version of the schematics. Since the |BMS-Master| and |BMS-Extension| were designed as one unit, the schematic may include pages that were left blank intentionally.

.. note::
	To manufacture the printed circuit boards, the BOM (Microsoft Excel file) in each corresponding repository should be used. Before sending the board layout to a PCB manufacturer, the layout files must be checked against the design rules provided by this manufacturer, since some board layout settings may depend on its specific design rules and may cause clearance violations (e.g., pad layout).
